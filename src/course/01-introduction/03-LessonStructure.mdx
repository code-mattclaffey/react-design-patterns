# Lesson Structure

As you will have already noticed in the sidebar that there is a "Lessons" section. Each lesson will get slightly more and more complex as we go on so it eases us into the course. Each lesson will also contain an "exercise.(tsx)" file and a "final.(tsx)".

## Exercise files

The best way to go about this course is to read through the content of the exercise and then at the end there is a challenge to complete in the exercise.tsx. In each file it will contain comments in the code which will guide you through the challenge. Each comment has an emoji which represents a certain meaning to the code, they are:

- 💣 Remove - We do not need this anymore so we can get rid of it
- 🤔 Thoughts - A question to get you thinking about that specific line of code
- ✍🏻 Resources - Some homework / resources to look into
- 💅 Highlight - This will be something we highlight that we have previously worked on in the course
- 💄 Styles - Some advice on how to style the element
- 🧪 Test - Try something out with the components
- ♿️ Accessibility - Some content about why you need certain elements to be a certain way
- 👨🏻‍💻 Add Code - We need to do something on this line

As mentioned, there will be a step by step guide through that will be broken down into numbered sections and a,b,c sub sections. For example:

```jsx
// 1a - 👨🏻‍💻 Create a component called Component that returns hello world
const Component = () => {
  // 1b - 👨🏻‍💻 add a useState that has false as default. Name the variable displayBox
  const [displayBox, setDisplayBox] = useState(false);

  // 2a - 🤔 How might we refactor these two functions so it would be called toggleDisplayBox();
  // 2a - ✍🏻 Look into useReducer useReducer((bool) => !bool, false);
  // 1c - 👨🏻‍💻 create me a showBox function which setsDisplayBox to be true
  const showBox = () => {
    setDisplayBox(true);
  };

  // 1d - 👨🏻‍💻 create me a hideBox function which setsDisplayBox to be false
  const hideBox = () => {
    setDisplayBox(false);
  };

  // 1e - 👨🏻‍💻 return a button which calls showBox or hideBox based on the value of displayBox and conditionally display a div with some text with Box as text
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={displayBox ? hideBox : showBox}>
        Toggle Box
      </button>
      {/* 💅 - This is an example of the conditional rendering pattern */}
      {displayBox && (
        // 💣 - Do we need a div here?
        <div>
          {/* 💄 - add text-blue as a className */}
          <p>Box</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Final files

If you get stuck do not worry! Each lesson.mdx file will have a video going through it all and there will be a final.tsx file showing the final solution of each exercise.
