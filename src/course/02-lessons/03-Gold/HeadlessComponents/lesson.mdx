# ðŸŽ­ Headless Components

Headless components provide logic and behavior without any UI. They separate business logic from presentation, allowing complete control over styling while reusing complex functionality across different designs.

## Basic Example

```jsx
// Headless component - logic only
const usePokemonBattle = () => {
  const [hp, setHp] = useState(100);
  const attack = () => setHp((prev) => Math.max(0, prev - 20));
  const heal = () => setHp((prev) => Math.min(100, prev + 30));

  return { hp, attack, heal, isDefeated: hp === 0 };
};

// UI components use the headless logic
const BattleCard = () => {
  const { hp, attack, heal, isDefeated } = usePokemonBattle();
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <div>HP: {hp}</div>
      <button onClick={attack}>Attack</button>
      <button onClick={heal}>Heal</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Exercise

In this exercise we have a Pokemon inventory system with tightly coupled UI and logic. Different teams need the same inventory functionality but with completely different designs - mobile cards, desktop tables, and admin dashboards.

Your task is to extract the inventory logic into a headless component, then create multiple UI implementations that use the same underlying functionality.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.

## When to use this pattern?

**Use headless components for:**

- **Complex Logic**: State machines, data fetching, form validation
- **Multiple UIs**: Same logic needed across different designs
- **Design Systems**: Consistent behavior with flexible presentation
- **Testing**: Easier to test logic separately from UI

**Avoid when:**

- **Simple Components**: Basic UI with minimal logic
- **Single Use**: Logic only needed in one place
- **Tight Coupling**: UI and logic are inherently connected
