# ðŸ§© Props Combination Pattern

Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The prop combination pattern groups related props into a single object. This object is then passed as a single prop to a component.

Some benefits of this pattern include reduction of boilerplate code, improving code readability and maintainability.

Let's take a look at an example with a Pokemon trading card:

```jsx
const PokemonCard = ({
  pokemonName,
  pokemonType,
  pokemonHp,
  pokemonLevel,
  attackName,
  attackDamage,
  attackDescription,
  imageAltText,
  imageUrlSmall,
  imageUrlMedium,
  imageUrlLarge,
  cardClassName,
  nameClassName,
  typeClassName,
  statsClassName,
  attackClassName
}) => <article>{/* Lots of Pokemon card code here... */}</article>;
```

Yes... this is pretty wild but it's very common to see this in the real world. What we have going into this Pokemon card component is:

- pokemon - name, type, hp, level
- attack - name, damage, description  
- image - the image sources and alt text
- styling - all className props

Now look at this when it is grouped:

```jsx
const PokemonCard = ({ pokemon, attack, image, styling }) => (
  <article>{/* Lots of Pokemon card code here... */}</article>
);
```

It is now a lot simpler to understand, we know the component needs pokemon data, an attack, an image, and styling options. If we then wanted to, we could easily add more pokemon stats or attacks.

## Exercise

In this exercise we are going to do the same thing that we did to the Pokemon card snippet above and then we have some extras to add to it so it will get you thinking about how to change the props if necessary.

You'll be refactoring a Pokemon trading card component that currently has too many individual props into a cleaner, grouped structure.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.
