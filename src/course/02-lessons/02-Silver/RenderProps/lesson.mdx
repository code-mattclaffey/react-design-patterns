# ðŸŽ¨ Render Props Pattern

Render props is a pattern where you pass a function as a prop (typically called **render**) that returns a React element. The component calls this function with data, allowing complete control over rendering.

## Basic Example

```jsx
const PokemonStats = ({ render }) => {
  const stats = { hp: 340, attack: 284 };
  return render(stats);
};

// Usage
<PokemonStats
  render={({ hp, attack }) => (
    <div>
      HP: {hp}, Attack: {attack}
    </div>
  )}
/>;
```

## Exercise

In this exercise we have a Pokemon type effectiveness calculator that's tightly coupled with a specific display format. Different teams want to use the calculation logic but with their own display components.

Your task is to refactor the component to use the render props pattern with a **render** prop, separating the calculation logic from the display.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.

## Why use this pattern?

Render props is valuable for:

- **Explicit API**: Clear, named render prop instead of overloaded children
- **Reusable Logic**: Share complex calculations across different UI implementations
- **Library Design**: Common pattern in popular libraries like React Router and Formik
- **Flexible Rendering**: Complete control over how data is displayed
