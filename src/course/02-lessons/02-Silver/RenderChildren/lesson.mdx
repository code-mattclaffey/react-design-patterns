# ðŸ”„ Render Children Pattern

Render Children is a pattern where you pass a render function through a custom prop (not children). This gives you explicit control over the API and allows multiple render functions.

## Basic Example

```jsx
const PokemonLoader = ({ renderPokemon, renderLoading }) => {
  const [pokemon, loading] = usePokemon();

  if (loading) return renderLoading();
  return renderPokemon(pokemon);
};

// Usage
<PokemonLoader
  renderPokemon={(pokemon) => <h1>{pokemon.name}</h1>}
  renderLoading={() => <p>Loading Pokemon...</p>}
/>;
```

## Exercise

In this exercise we have a Pokemon search component that handles loading, success, and error states but only supports one fixed display format. Different teams need different ways to display search results.

Your task is to refactor the search component to use render children pattern with separate render functions for each state.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.

## Why use this pattern?

Render Children is valuable for:

- **Multiple Render Functions**: Support different render functions for different states
- **Explicit API**: Clear, named props instead of overloaded children
- **Conditional Rendering**: Easy to handle multiple UI states
- **Library Design**: Common in data fetching and state management libraries
