# ðŸŽ¯ FACC (Function as Child Component) Pattern

FACC is a pattern where you pass a function as the children prop. The component calls this function with data, allowing complete control over rendering while sharing logic.

## Basic Example

```jsx
const PokemonData = ({ children }) => {
  const pokemon = { name: 'Pikachu', type: 'Electric' };
  return children(pokemon);
};

// Usage
<PokemonData>
  {(pokemon) => (
    <h1>
      {pokemon.name} is {pokemon.type} type!
    </h1>
  )}
</PokemonData>;
```

## Exercise

In this exercise we have a Pokemon battle simulator that's tightly coupled with a specific battle display. Different teams want to use the battle logic but with their own custom battle interfaces.

Your task is to refactor the battle simulator to use FACC pattern, separating the battle logic from the display components.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.

## Why use this pattern?

FACC is valuable for:

- **Clean API**: Uses the natural children prop instead of custom render props
- **Flexible Rendering**: Complete control over how data is displayed
- **Logic Reuse**: Share complex state management across different UIs
- **Component Libraries**: Create headless components that work with any design system
