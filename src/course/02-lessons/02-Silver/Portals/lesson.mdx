# ðŸŒŒ Portals Pattern

A React portal lets you render some children into a different part of the DOM. When you call the **createPortal** it will trigger the creation of the portal. When you unmount, the portal removes itself. This is how it looks in React:

```jsx
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

// ...

<div>
  <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
  {createPortal(
    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,
    document.body
  )}
</div>;
```

Which in html, will translate to:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My react app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <div>
        <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Portal benefits:

- Simplified state management
- No clashes with z-index as the modal is at the root of the DOM.

## Exercise

In the current application when a customer clicks the checkout cta and the payment popup appears, the customer cannot click the pay now button in the modal.
