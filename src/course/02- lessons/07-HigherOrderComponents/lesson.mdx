# Higher Order Components Pattern

In some cases you may want to have some logic that is consistent across your application. You could use hooks but this requires implementing some logic of code within each component you apply the hook which isn't sustainable as a higher order component.

## What does it look like syntactically

If you are familiar with functional programming this looks very similar to the "currying" pattern.

```jsx
// HigherOrderComponent.ts
export const withHigherOrderComponent = (Component) => (props) => {
  const { isAuth } = useAuthentication();

  if (!isAuth) {
    return <p>Not authenticated</p>;
  }

  return <Component {...props} />;
};

// Component.tsx
import { withHigherOrderComponent } from 'HigherOrderComponent.ts';

const Component = ({ foo }) => <p>{foo}</p>;

export default withHigherOrderComponent(Component);

// App.tsx

import Component from 'Component.tsx';

const App = () => {
  return <Component foo="bar" />;
};
```

> In React it is good practice to use the **with** at the start as the name associates to a higher order component.

Now let's breakdown what is actually going on here. You have the **withHigherOrderComponent** and it takes a Component as a prop and then you return another function with props which will normally be the props that the component will need that do not get provided by the higher order component.

## When would this be useful?

The logic in the higher order component is consolidated into one area which makes things more consistent across your application vs writing that line over and over again in every use case you need.

## Exercise

In this exercise we are going to go a bit wild and implement a very high level version of the Redux connect. The higher order component will pull information from a class which stores our data and then we will relay that data into the component.

> Blast from the past this if you have done this with old Redux... sorry ðŸ˜‰
