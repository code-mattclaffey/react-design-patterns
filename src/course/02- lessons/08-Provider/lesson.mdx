# Provider Pattern

The Provider Pattern is a design approach used to efficiently supply data to various parts of an application without the need to manually pass it down through multiple layers of components. In the context of React, this pattern helps avoid "prop drilling," where props have to be passed through each component in the hierarchy until they reach the desired component. Instead, by utilizing React Context, you can create a provider component that wraps parts of your app, making the necessary data or functionality available to all nested components. These components can then access the data or functions directly via custom React hooks, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Example

Here is an example of what a high level react context provider looks like:

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const FooContext = createContext();

const Component = () => {
  const footext = useContext(FooContext);

  return <p>{footext}</p>
}

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <FooContext.Provider value="bar">
      <Component />
    <FooContext.Provider />
  );
};
```

## Exercise

In this lesson we are going to implement the PokemonManager with the react content pattern and pull that information from a hook in our component. Head over to the exercise.tsx file to get started.
