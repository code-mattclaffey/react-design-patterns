# Props Combination Pattern

Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The prop combination pattern groups related props into a single object. This object is then passed as a single prop to a component.

Some benefits of this pattern include reduction of boilerplate code, improving code readability and maintainability.

Let's take a look at an example:

```jsx
const CardComponent = ({
  title,
  subText,
  ctaText,
  ctaUrl,
  imageAltText,
  imageUrlMobile,
  imageUrlTablet,
  imageUrlDesktop,
  containerClassName,
  titleClassName,
  subTextClassName,
  ctaClassName,
  imageClassName
}) => <article>{/* Lots of imaginary code here... */}</article>;
```

Yes... this is pretty wild but it's very common to see this in the real world. What we have going into this component is:

- image - the image sources, imageAltText
- cta - text and ctaUrl
- content - title, sub title
- classNames - all classNames

Now look at this when it is grouped:

```jsx
const CardComponent = ({ title, subText, cta, image }) => (
  <article>{/* Lots of imaginary code here... */}</article>
);
```

It is now a lot simpler to understand, we know the component has a title, it also needs a cta and an image. If we then wanted to, we would add some styles in case we need to tweak the card.

## Exercise

In this exercise we are going to do the same thing that we did to the card snippet above and then we have some extras to add to it so it will get you thinking about how to change the props if necessary.

Head over to the exercise file and let's begin.
